# COVID-Retriever-QA

The recent advances in Natural Language Pro- cessing have enabled conversational AI tech- nologies to reach widespread adoption. These conversational agents offer strong potential to disseminate crucial information. Recently, the spread of the COVID-19 disease has impacted human lives to a great extent and has raised special concerns. In situations like this, it is important that users are able to receive precise and accurate answers to their health-related queries. Thus, we aim to build an end-to- end conversational model that is able to pro- vide curated information related to COVID- 19. In this project, we propose a Retriever-QA model. Given a question and a large document with COVID-19 related data, a retriever re- ranks candidate paragraphs with answers and a Question-Answering (QA) model fetches the right answer from the re-ranked paragraphs. Given limited COVID-19 related data, we ex- periment with different re-ranking networks and datasets to boost the performance of the QA model. We find that our model generalizes well on the COVID-19 dataset and achieves an accuracy of 89%.
