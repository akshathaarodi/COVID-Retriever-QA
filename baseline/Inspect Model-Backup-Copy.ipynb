       "'[CLS] die ##l vertical migration ( d ##v ##m ) , also known as di ##urn ##al vertical migration , is a pattern of movement used by some organisms , such as cope ##pods , living in the ocean and in lakes . the migration occurs when organisms move up to the ep ##ipe ##lag ##ic zone at night and return to the me ##sop ##ela ##gic zone of the oceans or to the h ##yp ##oli ##m ##nio ##n zone of lakes during the day . the word die ##l comes from the latin dies day , and means a 24 - hour period . it is the greatest migration in the world in terms of biomass . this form of migration is not restricted to any one taxa as examples are known from crust ##ace ##ans ( cope ##pods ) , mo ##llus ##cs ( squid ) , and ray - finn ##ed fishes ( trout ) . there are various stimuli responsible for this phenomenon , the most prominent being response to changes in light intensity , though evidence suggests that biological clock s are an underlying stimulus as well . there are a number of potential reasons to explain the phenomenon in nature , though it is most typically to access food and avoid predators . while this mass migration is typically nocturnal , with the animals ascending from the depths at nightfall and descending at sunrise , novel types of vertical migration can occur in response to the different cues and stimuli that trigger migration . some novel events include the absence of d ##v ##m during midnight sun in arctic regions and the sudden onset of migration due to a solar eclipse .
